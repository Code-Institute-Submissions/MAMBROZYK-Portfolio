As a recruiter I expect be able to find Michal's resume following LinkedIn link.

### Strategy

My goal in the design was to create a simple,easy to navigate website.

### Scope

For employers, I wanted to provide them with some brief information about my skills and my work.In the Work section of my website they can view projects I have worked on and have access to both the live version and the GitHub repository by clicking on the Font Awesome icons. They are also able to view my social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the footer or in the navigation menu.

### Structure

In the about section I wanted to provide a overview of my skills,and in work section a showcase of my projects,with links to repositories and live pages.

## Technologies

2.CSS\
3.Bootstrap (4.3.1)

## Features

This site uses collapsible navbar to manage the navigation list on smaller screens.

In the future I would like to add more projects.I would also like to change the animations in My Skills section of my website to a design that will display better on smaller screens.

## Testing

Aim of the test was to verify that the webiste works correctly across different operating systems,browsers and devices.
Website was tested on Google Chrome,Firefox and Opera browsers in their latest versions.Website was tested on multiple mobile device (Phone5,6,XR Samsung Galaxy s5,Apple Ipad) to ensure compatibility and responsivness.Chrome developer tools were also used to check for compatibility and responsiveness.Collapsible navbar works correctly on mobile devices. Code was validated using W3C validation service.All links were tested manually and will open in new browser tab.
More detailed list of tested items and results can be found [here](https://github.com/misza80/MAMBROZYK-Portfolio/blob/master/Testresults.md).

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.
In order to setup github pages I did the following:

..\* **Created a new repository**
From the main page I clicked on "New repository" button,gave it a name and clicked "Create a repository" button.

..\* **Published my website**
While on the repository main page clicked on "Settings" tab, scrolled down to "Github pages" section.From the dropdown menu chose "master branch" and clicked "Save" button.

..\* **VS Code Setup**
For writing code I used VisualStudio Code (VS Code).
To get VS Code working correctly with GitHub,you need to install latest version of Git first,after that you can install VS Code.
When installation finished I have cloned my repository,first by copying to clipboard the link to repository from the github page and then pasting it after `git clone` command into VS Code terminal.
After selecting the save folder, proceded to creating files and folders for my project.
From the source control tab I could stage and commit changes to the repository.
After entering the commit message I was able to push the commited changes.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/misza80/MAMBROZYK-Portfolio.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
