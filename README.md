# Strategy

My goal in the design was to create a simple,easy to navigate website.

# Scope

For employers, I wanted to provide them with some brief information about my skills and my work.In the Work section of my website they can view projects I have worked on and have access to both the live version and the GitHub repository by clicking on the Font Awesome icons. They are also able to view my social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the footer or in the navigation menu.

# Structure

In the about section I wanted to provide a overview of my skills,and in work section a showcase of my projects,with links to repositories and live pages.

## Technologies

## Features

This site uses collapsible navbar to manage the navigation list on smaller screens.

In the future I would like to add more projects.I would also like to change the animations in My Skills section of my website to a design that will display better on smaller screens.

## Testing

Website was tested on Google Chrome,Firefox and Opera browsers in their latest versions.Website was tested on multiple mobile device (Phone5,6,XR Samsung Galaxy s5,Apple Ipad) to ensure compatibility and responsivness.Collapsible navbar works correctly on mobile devices. Code was validated using W3C validation service.All links were tested manually and will open in new browser tab.
